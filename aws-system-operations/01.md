# System operations notes
Instance metadata at 169.254.169.254 - handy

## Containers / Serverless

Containers offer lovely things:
- Environmental consistency
- Operational efficiency
- Developer productivity
- Version control

Fargate:
- Go use it
- it's more expensive
- For isolated containers

## Networking

SSH agent forwarding (bastion host)

### Troubleshooting

Subnets can't connect:
- Verify it's a network issue, not an instance issue
- Check NACLs
- Check VPC Flow logs

NAT config doesn't work
- Check route table association

Peered network:
- Peering request approval
- Route table configuration
- Are network ACLs forbidding all external traffic
- Check SG configs on resources
- Use CIDR block rules in VPC A to allow access from VPC B
