# Adding compute

What we're using:
- EC2
- instance types/families
- EBS
- Compliance options

## EC2

What can it do?
- Web hosting
- Databases
- Auth
- Anything a server can do

VMs vs. Physical servers
- VMs are disposable:
  - data driven decisions
  - quick iteration
  - free to make mistakes
  - short feedback loops on mistakes

#### AMIs

AMIs are essentially just the state in which your instance is launched.
